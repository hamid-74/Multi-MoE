So $2 c + 1 = a + b = (2 c_1 + 1) + (2 c_2 + 1) = 2 (c_1 + c_2 + 1)$. Since the left hand side is odd and the right hand side is even, we have a contradiction.

Then there exist positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a = b + 1$, $b = c + 1$, and $a b c$ is not divisible by $6$. Since $a b c$ is not divisible by $6$, $a b c$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$. Since $a b c$ is not divisible by $2$, $a$, $b$, or $c$ is not divisible by $2$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are consecutive integers, $a$ is odd. Since $a b c$ is not divisible by $3$, $a$, $b$, or $c$ is not divisible by $3$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are consecutive integers, $a$ is not divisible by $3$. Hence $a$ is odd and not divisible by $3$, which implies that $a$ is not divisible by $6$. This is a contradiction.

It is a very efficient algorithm that can be used to find a pattern in a text very quickly.\n\n## How does the Boyer-Moore algorithm work?\n\nThe Boyer-Moore algorithm works by comparing the pattern to the text from right to left. It starts by comparing the last character of the pattern to the last character of the text. If they are the same, it moves on to the next character. If they are not the same, it moves on to the next character.\n\n## What are the benefits of using the Boyer-Moore algorithm?\n\nThe Boyer-Moore algorithm is a very efficient algorithm that can be used to find a pattern in a text very quickly. It is also a very simple algorithm to understand and implement.\n\n## What are the drawbacks of using the Boyer-Moore algorithm?\n\nThe Boyer-Moore algorithm is not always the most efficient algorithm to use. It can be slower than other algorithms if the pattern is not found in the text.\n\n## How can the Boyer-Moore algorithm be used in real-world applications?\n\nThe Boyer-Moore algorithm can be used in a variety of real-world applications.
